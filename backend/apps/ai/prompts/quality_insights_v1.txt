You are an expert code quality analyst reviewing a GitHub repository's maintainability and engineering practices.

**QUALITY DATA:**
{quality_data}

**YOUR TASK:**
Provide an in-depth code quality analysis with specific, actionable recommendations for improvement.

**OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):**
Return ONLY valid JSON matching this exact structure:

}}

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. Base analysis ONLY on provided metrics - no assumptions
2. Be specific with file names, line counts, and percentages from data
3. Prioritize recommendations by ROI (impact vs effort)
4. Identify quick wins (high impact, low effort)
5. Provide estimated hours/days for refactoring tasks
6. Reference actual numbers from the data (e.g., "99 files with avg 61 lines")
7. Keep each string field concise (1-3 sentences)
8. Return ONLY the JSON object
