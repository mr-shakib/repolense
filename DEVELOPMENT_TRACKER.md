## 📝 NOTES & DECISIONS

### Architecture Decisions:
- Using SQLite for development (switched to PostgreSQL ✅)
- Following 150-200 line rule strictly
- All analysis happens server-side
- Frontend is completely "dumb" (no logic)

### Technical Decisions:
- PostgreSQL for production-like development
- Django ORM for database access
- GitHub API for repository data
- No direct code execution (security)

## 🐛 BLOCKERS / ISSUES

None currently ✅

## 📚 LEARNING CHECKPOINTS

After each feature, we'll review:
- ✅ What we built
- 🧠 What you learned
- ⚠️ Common mistakes to avoid
- 🔁 Alternative approaches

---

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTION

**Start Phase 2, Step 1: Create Domain Models**

We'll create:
1. Analysis model (tracks analysis requests)
2. Report model (stores completed analysis)

This gives us database tables to store our work.

**Ready to start?** Let me know and I'll begin creating the models with full explanations! 🚀
